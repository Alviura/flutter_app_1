# flutter_app_1

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

### Description of the files in this repo
1. pubspec.yaml -> specifies basic information about the app, such as the current versio, its dependencies, and the assets with which it will ship

2. analysis_options.yaml -> determines how strict flutter should be when analyzing your code. 

This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to check for errors, warnings, and lints.
